Notes from Sam Golob.

I took the liberty of customizing this beautiful work from
my friend Deru, in the following way.  Submit member called
JCCATS instead of member JCCAT, which goes against member
ASSEMBLS instead of against Deru's member ASSEMBLE.

SMALL CHANGES:

1.  ADDED FLAG(5) INTO THE ASSEMBLY PARMS, TO ELIMINATE THE
    RETURN CODE 4 FROM THE 2 MESSAGES:

    ASMA303W Multiple address resolutions may result ...

2.  I WANTED TO ALTER THE LOAD MODULE CCAT TO GIVE IT AN SSI
    THAT WOULD IDENTIFY IT, SO I ADDED AN EXTRA STEP TO INVOKE
    THE PDS COMMAND (CBT FILE 182) AGAINST THE LOAD MODULE,
    IN BATCH, TO ADD THE SSI THAT I WANTED IT TO HAVE.

3.  I ADDED A TSO HELP MEMBER, #CCAT, BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU
    NEED A REMINDER ABOUT HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM.


Deru did a beautiful job.  That's all folks.....
